Authentication vs Authorization
    * Authentication - verify a user (with username and password)
    * Authorization - verify the resources that allows or denies access (teachers can view current homework for all students, students cannot have access to that)

    * API keys
    * OAuth Tokens (OAuth 2.0)
    * JWT Tokens
